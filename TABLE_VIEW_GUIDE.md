## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Person not found" error in bulk relationships

**Cause**: Name doesn't match exactly what's in the system

**Solutions**:
1. Check spelling and spacing
2. Try different name format (First Last vs Last, First)
3. Export people to CSV to see exact names
4. Use autocomplete (if available) to verify names

---

### Issue: CSV import creates duplicate people

**Cause**: Names are similar but not exact matches

**Prevention**:
1. Always check for existing people first
2. Use consistent name format
3. Export existing people to reference during import
4. Review import summary before confirming

**Solution**:
- Delete duplicates manually
- Use Full Edit to merge data
- Re-import with corrected names

---

### Issue: Inline edit doesn't save

**Cause**: Required fields are empty or invalid

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure First Name is filled
2. Check that Category and Status have valid values
3. Look for error messages
4. Cancel and try Full Edit mode instead

---

### Issue: Relationship type not recognized

**Cause**: CSV uses custom type not in predefined list

**Solution**:
1. Replace with closest predefined type:
   - family, friend, enemy, associate, employer
   - suspect, witness, victim, other
2. Use "other" for custom relationships
3. Add detail in Note field
